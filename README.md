  ## Description

  This application is an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list. It uses Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. Since there is no seed data and no front end, users can use test data and make fetch requests with Insomnia.
